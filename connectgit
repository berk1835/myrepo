##### How to connect GitHub repository 'myrepo' with git and local computer ('pull'), then update your changes ('push') to GitHub
##### Make sure you have Git installed - https://gitforwindows.org/

##### This script amended from https://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html#push-pull-github ######

## Clone repo to local computer
git clone https://github.com/berk1835/myrepo.git


## Make this new repo your working directory, list its files, display the README
cd myrepo
ls
head README.md
git remote show origin


## Add a line to README and verify that Git notices the change
echo "A line I wrote on my local computer  " >> README.md
git status


## Stage (“add”) and commit this change and push to your remote repo on GitHub
git add README.md
git commit -m "A commit from my local computer"
git push


##  Reveal the current line ending configuration. It should state 'true'.
git config --show-origin --get core.autocrlf


## Confirm this on your browser GitHub 'myrepo'
## Clean up local computer
cd ..
rm -rf myrepo/
